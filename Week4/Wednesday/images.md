# Transforming Images

### Image 1: My dog and Landscape with black figure by Amadeo de Souza-Cardoso

Here are the two sources images. I chose the first because it is a picture of my dog, buddy. It is a picture I took about a year ago of him wearing my dad's glasses, and it is one of my favorite pictures. I mixed it with the second image because I really liked the style of it, and thought buddy would look funny with that style applied. Here is the result:

I really like the result. He looks almost surreal, enjoying the cityscape. All he needs now is to be holding up a newpaper and coffee and he will fit right in. I really like the resulting image, the top left has some weird imperfections but everything else I really like. I did 5 epochs of each section, as it seemed to not improve much after a few epochs. 

### Image 2: My cat and space

The second image I chose was my cat and a picture of space, called "Cosmic Winter Wonderland". This image was from shortly after I had gotten my new cat, Chloe. I know its a bit boring to choose pet images but I think they both really work. I chose an image of space because it seems as though she is staring off into the void, and it would really work well with that. I love this image of her too, so it meant a lot to me. Here is the result:

This Image isn't perfect, I think it hides the cat a bit much, but it does almost make her look like she is a part of space. It looks really cool. Especially near her feet, it looks like they are just stars instead of cat legs. Overall I think this came out really well.

This is buddy put through the deep dream thing. It is really trippy and looks super fascinating.

Here is it applied to Chloe. It works a little too well though, and you can hardly tell its the same picture.
