# Thursday 

For today, we fit two datasets into an image classification algorithm. I ran into a lot of difficulties around getting the dataset working, but eventually I was able to get it working. All models were run to 25 epochs.

As you can see on the graph, the validation loss is actually best at  the beginning, and slowly gets worse over time. The validation accuracy is similar but less dramatic. The highly accurate training set leads me to believe that
